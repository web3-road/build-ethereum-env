# Ethereum PoS Private Chain Setup - Genesis Directory

This directory contains essential files for setting up the genesis block of the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain. Below is a brief overview of the files included in this directory:

- **deposit_contract.sol**: This file contains the Solidity code for the deposit contract, which is crucial for handling deposits to the beacon chain.

- **genesis.ssz**: This file is the serialized representation of the genesis state, which defines the initial state of the blockchain.

- **genesis.json**: This file includes the configuration settings for the genesis block, specifying parameters such as the chain ID, initial validators, and other critical settings.

- **config.yaml**: This file contains configuration settings for the private chain, allowing for customization of various parameters related to the network.

For detailed instructions on how to use these files and set up your Ethereum PoS private chain, please refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory and the README files in the relevant components.
