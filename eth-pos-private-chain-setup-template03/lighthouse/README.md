# Lighthouse Tools Documentation

This directory contains resources and documentation for the Lighthouse client, which is an implementation of the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) client.

## Overview

Lighthouse is a client for the Ethereum 2.0 network, designed to be efficient and secure. It implements the consensus layer of Ethereum's PoS mechanism and is responsible for block production and validation.

## Getting Started

To get started with Lighthouse, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Refer to the installation guide in the Lighthouse documentation.

2. **Configuration**: Configure your Lighthouse client using the `lighthouse-config.yaml` file located in the `config` directory. This file contains essential settings for network parameters and logging options.

3. **Running the Client**: Use the Lighthouse binary located in the `lighthouse` directory to start the client. You can run commands to start the beacon node, validator, and other components.

4. **Genesis Block Setup**: The `genesis` directory contains resources related to the genesis block setup. Ensure you have the correct `genesis.ssz` and `genesis.json` files configured for your network.

## Features

- **Beacon Node**: Lighthouse includes a beacon node that manages the consensus layer and communicates with other nodes in the network.
- **Validator Client**: Participate in the consensus process by running the validator client, which proposes and attests to blocks.
- **Deposit CLI**: Use the deposit CLI tool to create deposit transactions for validators.
