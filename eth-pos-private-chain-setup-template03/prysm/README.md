# Prysm Tools Documentation

This README provides documentation specific to the Prysm tools used in the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain setup. Below are the components included in this directory and their respective functionalities.

## Components

### Deposit CLI
The Deposit CLI is a command-line tool used to create deposit transactions for validators. It allows users to generate the necessary deposit data that validators need to participate in the Ethereum PoS network.

#### Usage
1. Navigate to the `deposit-cli` directory.
2. Run the CLI with the appropriate parameters to create a deposit transaction.
3. Follow the prompts to input the required information.

### Beacon Chain
The Beacon Chain is responsible for managing the consensus layer of the Ethereum PoS network. It coordinates the validators and ensures that the network reaches consensus on the state of the blockchain.

#### Usage
1. Navigate to the `beacon-chain` directory.
2. Start the beacon chain node using the provided scripts or commands.
3. Monitor the logs to ensure the beacon chain is functioning correctly.

### Validator
The Validator component is used to participate in the consensus process by proposing and attesting to blocks. Validators play a crucial role in securing the network and earning rewards for their participation.

#### Usage
1. Navigate to the `validator` directory.
2. Configure the validator settings as per your requirements.
3. Start the validator client to begin participating in the consensus process.
