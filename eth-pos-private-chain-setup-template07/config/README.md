# Ethereum PoS Private Chain Setup Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain setup. Below is a brief overview of the files included in this directory:

## Files

- **genesis.json**: 
  This file contains the configuration for the genesis block, including the initial state of the blockchain. It defines parameters such as the initial validators, their balances, and other essential settings required to launch the private chain.

- **config.yaml**: 
  This configuration file holds general settings for the Ethereum PoS private chain setup. It includes network parameters, logging options, and other configurations that affect the behavior of the chain and its clients.

## Usage

To utilize these configuration files, ensure that they are correctly referenced in your setup scripts and client configurations. Modify the parameters as necessary to fit your specific requirements for the private chain.

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the Ethereum PoS private chain, please refer to the main README.md file located in the root directory of this project.
