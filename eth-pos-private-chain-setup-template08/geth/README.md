# Ethereum PoS Private Chain Setup - Geth Client

This directory contains the necessary files and instructions for setting up and running the Geth client as part of the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain.

## Overview

Geth (Go Ethereum) is the official Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In this setup, Geth will be used in conjunction with the Prysm or Lighthouse clients to create a private Ethereum PoS network.

## Files

- **genesis.json**: This file contains the genesis configuration for the Geth client. It defines the initial state of the blockchain, including the initial accounts and their balances.

- **start_geth.sh**: This shell script is used to start the Geth client with the specified configuration. It sets up the necessary parameters and launches the Geth node.

## Instructions

1. **Configure Genesis**: Before starting Geth, ensure that the `genesis.json` file is properly configured according to your network requirements.

2. **Start Geth**: Run the following command to start the Geth client:
   ```bash
   ./start_geth.sh
   ```

3. **Connect to Prysm or Lighthouse**: Ensure that your Prysm or Lighthouse client is running and configured to connect to the Geth node.

4. **Deploy Contracts**: Use the provided deposit contracts in the `prysm/deposit-contract` or `lighthouse/deposit-contract` directories to deploy the necessary contracts for staking.

5. **Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on the Geth logs for any errors or important information regarding the node's status.
