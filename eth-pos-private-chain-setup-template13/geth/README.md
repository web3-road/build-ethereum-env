# Ethereum PoS Private Chain Setup - Geth

This directory contains files related to the Geth client for setting up an Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain.

## Files

- **genesis.json**: This file contains the genesis block configuration for the Geth client. It defines the initial state of the blockchain, including parameters such as the chain ID, difficulty, and accounts.

- **start-geth.sh**: This shell script is used to start the Geth client. It includes the necessary commands to initialize and run the Geth node with the specified configurations.

## Usage

1. **Configure the Genesis Block**: Before starting Geth, ensure that the `genesis.json` file is properly configured according to your network requirements.

2. **Start Geth**: Run the `start-geth.sh` script to initialize and start the Geth client. This will set up the node and begin syncing with the network.

3. **Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on the logs generated by Geth to ensure that the node is running smoothly and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

For more detailed instructions and configurations, refer to the README files in the root directory and other relevant components of the project.
