# Prysm Tool Documentation

## Overview
Prysm is a client for the Ethereum 2.0 network, specifically designed to support the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This documentation provides installation instructions, configuration details, and usage guidelines for setting up and running the Prysm client in an Ethereum PoS private chain environment.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. **Clone the Prysm Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm.git
   cd prysm
   ```
3. **Build the Prysm Client**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Configuration
The configuration for the Prysm client is defined in the `config/config.yaml` file. This file includes parameters for the beacon node and validator settings. Ensure to modify this file according to your network requirements.

## Genesis State
The `config/genesis.ssz` file contains the serialized genesis state for the Prysm blockchain. This file defines the initial state of the blockchain and must be generated before starting the Prysm client.

## Scripts
The `scripts/generate_genesis.sh` script automates the process of generating the genesis file for the Prysm client. You can run this script to create the necessary genesis state based on your configuration.

## Usage
To start the Prysm beacon node, use the following command:
```bash
./beacon-chain --config=config/config.yaml
```

To start the validator client, use:
```bash
./validator --config=config/config.yaml
```
