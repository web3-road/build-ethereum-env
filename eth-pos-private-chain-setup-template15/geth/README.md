# Geth Client for Ethereum PoS Private Chain

This directory contains the necessary files and instructions for setting up and running the Geth client as part of the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain setup.

## Overview

Geth (Go Ethereum) is the official Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol. It allows you to run a full Ethereum node and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. In the context of a PoS private chain, Geth works alongside the Prysm or Lighthouse clients to facilitate block production and consensus.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Geth**: Ensure that you have Geth installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Geth GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases).

2. **Configure Genesis**: The `genesis.json` file in this directory defines the initial state of your private chain. You may need to modify it according to your specific requirements, such as network ID, consensus mechanism, and initial accounts.

3. **Initialize the Blockchain**:
   Run the following command to initialize your Geth node with the genesis configuration:
   ```
   geth init genesis.json --datadir <your_data_directory>
   ```

4. **Start Geth**:
   To start the Geth client, use the following command:
   ```
   geth --datadir <your_data_directory> --networkid <your_network_id> --http --http.port 8545 --http.api "admin,eth,net,web3" --allow-insecure-unlock
   ```

5. **Connect to Consensus Layer**: Ensure that your Geth client is properly connected to the consensus layer (Prysm or Lighthouse) to facilitate block production.

6. **Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on the Geth logs for any errors or important information regarding the node's operation.
