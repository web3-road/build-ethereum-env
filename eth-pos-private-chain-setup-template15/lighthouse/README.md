# Lighthouse Client Setup for Ethereum PoS Private Chain

This README provides instructions and information related to the Lighthouse client, which is one of the implementations for the Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Lighthouse is designed to be efficient and easy to use, making it a great choice for running a validator on your private Ethereum PoS chain.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- Rust (with `cargo` package manager)
- Git

## Directory Structure

The Lighthouse setup is organized as follows:

```
lighthouse/
├── README.md
├── config/
│   ├── testnet-spec.yaml
│   └── genesis.ssz
└── scripts/
    └── generate_genesis.sh
```

## Configuration

### testnet-spec.yaml

This file contains the configuration settings for the Lighthouse client, including parameters for the testnet specifications. You can modify this file to suit your specific requirements for the private chain.

### genesis.ssz

This file is the serialized genesis state for the Lighthouse client. It defines the initial state of the blockchain and should be generated using the provided script.

## Scripts

### generate_genesis.sh

This script automates the process of generating the genesis file for the Lighthouse client. To run the script, navigate to the `scripts` directory and execute the following command:

```bash
bash generate_genesis.sh
```

Make sure to review the script and adjust any parameters as necessary before running it.

## Running Lighthouse

Once you have configured the Lighthouse client and generated the genesis file, you can start the Lighthouse beacon node and validator. Refer to the official Lighthouse documentation for detailed instructions on how to run the client and manage validators.
