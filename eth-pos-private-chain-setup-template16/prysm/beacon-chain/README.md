# Beacon Chain Component of Prysm

This directory contains information and documentation related to the beacon chain component of the Prysm client. The beacon chain is a crucial part of Ethereum's Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, responsible for coordinating the network and managing validators.

## Overview

The beacon chain serves several key functions:

- **Validator Management**: It keeps track of validators and their stakes, ensuring that they are participating correctly in the consensus process.
- **Slot and Epoch Management**: The beacon chain organizes the blockchain into slots and epochs, which are essential for the PoS mechanism.
- **Crosslinks**: It facilitates communication between shards in the Ethereum 2.0 architecture, allowing for scalability and efficient data handling.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the beacon chain, follow these steps:

1. **Install Prysm**: Ensure you have the Prysm client installed. Refer to the [Prysm installation guide](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install-prysm) for detailed instructions.

2. **Configure the Beacon Chain**: Modify the configuration files as needed. The configuration files can be found in the `config` directory.

3. **Start the Beacon Chain**: Use the provided scripts to start the beacon chain. You can find the scripts in the `scripts` directory.

4. **Monitor the Beacon Chain**: Use the monitoring tools provided by Prysm to keep track of the beacon chain's performance and health.
