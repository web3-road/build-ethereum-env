# Genesis Directory Overview

This directory contains essential files related to the genesis block of the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain setup. Below is a brief description of each file:

- **deposit_contract.sol**: This file contains the Solidity code for the deposit contract, which is crucial for the Ethereum PoS mechanism. It defines how validators can deposit their funds to participate in the network.

- **genesis.ssz**: This file is the serialized representation of the genesis state for the Ethereum PoS private chain. It includes the initial state of the blockchain and is used to bootstrap the network.

The files in this directory are integral to the successful deployment and operation of the Ethereum PoS private chain. Ensure that you understand the purpose of each file and how they interact with the overall setup.
