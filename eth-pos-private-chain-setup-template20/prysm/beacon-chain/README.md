2. **Configuration**: Modify the `beacon-chain.yaml` configuration file located in the `../config` directory to suit your network requirements.

3. **Start the Beacon Chain**: Use the following command to start the beacon chain:

   ```
   ./prysm-beacon-chain --config ../config/beacon-chain.yaml
   ```

4. **Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on the logs to ensure the beacon chain is running smoothly and to troubleshoot any issues.
