# Ethereum PoS Private Chain Genesis Setup

This directory contains the necessary files and scripts for setting up the genesis block of an Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain. 

## Overview

The genesis block is the first block in the blockchain and serves as the foundation for the entire network. It contains important configuration parameters and the initial state of the blockchain.

## Files

- **deposit_contract.sol**: This Solidity file implements the deposit contract required for the PoS setup. It is essential for validators to deposit their funds and participate in the network.

- **create_genesis.sh**: This script is used to create the genesis block for the Ethereum private chain. It includes commands to generate the genesis block based on specified parameters.

- **genesis.ssz**: This file contains the serialized genesis state for the Ethereum private chain. It is used by the beacon nodes to initialize the chain.

## Usage

1. **Deposit Contract**: Ensure that the deposit contract is properly implemented and compiled. This contract is crucial for validator participation.

2. **Create Genesis Block**: Run the `create_genesis.sh` script to generate the genesis block. This will set up the initial state of the blockchain.

3. **Genesis State**: The `genesis.ssz` file will be generated and should be used by the beacon nodes to start the network.

By following these instructions, you will be able to successfully set up the genesis block for your Ethereum PoS private chain.
