# Geth for Ethereum PoS Private Chain

This directory contains the necessary files and instructions for setting up and running the Geth client as part of the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) private chain environment.

## Overview

Geth (Go Ethereum) is the official Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol. It allows you to run a full Ethereum node, which is essential for participating in the Ethereum network, especially in a private chain setup.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Geth**: Ensure you have Geth installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Geth repository](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).

2. **Configure Genesis Block**: 
   - Modify the `genesis.json` file in this directory to set up the initial state of your private chain. This includes defining the network parameters and initial accounts.

3. **Start Geth**:
   - Use the provided script `start-geth.sh` to initialize and start the Geth client. This script will set up the necessary configurations and start the node.

4. **Connect to Beacon Nodes**:
   - Ensure that your Geth client is properly configured to connect with the Prysm or Lighthouse beacon nodes, as they are essential for the PoS mechanism.

## Running Geth

To start the Geth client, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash start-geth.sh
```

This will initialize the Geth client with the configurations specified in `genesis.json`.

## Additional Information

For more detailed instructions on configuring and using Geth, refer to the official [Geth documentation](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/). 

Make sure to also check the README files in the `prysm` and `lighthouse` directories for information on setting up and running those components of the Ethereum PoS private chain.
